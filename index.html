            <ul>
                <li>What is the distribution of catheter indication amongst males and females?</li>
                <li>Is there a specific year when each indication peaks or dips noticeably in the data? (changed from: Have any indications for catheters become prevalent in a specific year?)</li>

            <p>
                I wanted to explore the data concerning their "indication for catheter", which refers to the result from or cause of the patients' cardiac catheterization -- which is a procedure used to diagnose and treat cardiovascular conditions. In the dataset there were four possible indications from a patient's catheter file:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>acute coronary syndrome</b>: an umbrella term for situations where the blood supplied to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked <sup>[1]</sup></li>
                <li><b>stable angina</b>(also known as angina pectoris): chest pain or discomfort due to coronary heart disease<sup>[2]</sup>, which is a term for the buildup of plaque in the heart's arteries which can lead to heart attack<sup>[3]</sup></li>
                <li>other</li>
                <li>the indication is unknown/not entered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of the four, only two of them are actually a cardiovascular condition; <i>other</i> may indicate a condition that doesn't fall into the previous two categories but is still a known condition.</p>

            <p>To answer my question I looked at the record counts of these indications and viewed them by sex, year, and then both, and marked anything I thought was noteworthy as well as showed the trendlines for the record counts by year.</p>

            <p>First let's look at the gist of the data:</p>
            <div class="float-left" style="left:960px;bottom:-100px;">
                <p>This bar graph shows the total count of files over all the years recorded in the dataset for each indication for a catheter.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="float-left" style="left:960px;bottom:-420px;">
                <p>This line graph shows the total (both sexes together) record count of the different catheter indications from 2008 to 2016. Noticeable peaks and dips are shown too.</p>
                <p>The black lines are the actual counts, the red dotted lines are <b>linear</b> trendlines.</p>
            </div>

            <img src="approach99-q1a.png">

            <p>These graphs are pretty straightforward and were made by graphing the catheter indication and sex/year data against the count of number of records. There were no rows that contained null values.</p>
            <p>I found that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Acute coronary syndrome clearly has the highest count for both sexes</li>
                <li>Females consistently have a lower record count, roughly 1:2 female-to-male ratio in every category</li>
                <li>In general the number of patients receiving a catheter procedure is increasing until 2016
                        <ul>
                        <li>There's a peak-dip-peak pattern between 2012-2015 for acute coronary syndrome</li>
                        <li>You can see a dip in patient records in 2012 for stable angina</li>
                        <li>Records for 'other' conditions dipped in 2013 and then rose until 2015</li>
                        <li>There are very few records whether either the data entries were unknown or not recorded. 2012 has the highest count for unknown data</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                <li>The 'Unknown' category looks like a hump so the trendline is pretty flat</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The r-squared and p-values for the trendlines (trimmed to 4 decimal places, not rounded):</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Indication</th>
                    <th>R-squared</th>
