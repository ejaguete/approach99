            Question 1
            <ul>
                <li>What is the distribution of catheter indication amongst males and females?</li>
                <li>Is there a specific year when each indication peaks or dips noticeably in the data? (changed from: Have any indications for catheters become prevalent in a specific year?)</li>
                <li>What are the trends of the recorded indications?</li>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>
                I wanted to explore the data concerning their "indication for catheter", which refers to the result from or cause of the patients' cardiac catheterization -- which is a procedure used to diagnose and treat cardiovascular conditions. In the dataset there were four possible indications from a patient's catheter file:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>acute coronary syndrome</b>: an umbrella term for situations where the blood supplied to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked <sup>[1]</sup></li>
                <li><b>stable angina</b>(also known as angina pectoris): chest pain or discomfort due to coronary heart disease<sup>[2]</sup>, which is a term for the buildup of plaque in the heart's arteries which can lead to heart attack<sup>[3]</sup></li>
                <li>other</li>
                <li>the indication is unknown/not entered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of the four, only two of them are actually a cardiovascular condition; <i>other</i> may indicate a condition that doesn't fall into the previous two categories but is still a known condition.</p>

            <p>To answer my question I looked at the record counts of these indications and viewed them by sex, year, and then both, and marked anything I thought was noteworthy as well as showed the trendlines for the record counts by year.</p>

            <p>First let's look at the gist of the data. (Hover over the charts for more info!)</p>

            <div class="image">

                <!-- graph info -->

                <div class="float-box" style="left:760px;bottom:450px;">
                    <p>This bar graph shows the total count of files over all the years recorded in the dataset for each indication for a catheter.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:760px;bottom:100px;">
                    <p>This line graph shows the total (both sexes together) record count of the different catheter indications from 2008 to 2016. Noticeable peaks and dips are shown too.</p>
                    <p>The black lines are the actual counts, the red dotted lines are <b>polynomial (degree 2)</b> trendlines.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- info -->
                <div class="float-box" style="left:10px; bottom:470px;">
                    <p>Acute coronary syndrome clearly has the highest count for both sexes</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:410px; bottom:470px;">
                    <p>Females consistently have a lower record count, roughly 1:2 female-to-male ratio in every category</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:150px;bottom:20px;">
                    <p>In general there's a positive trend for number of patients over the years for each category</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>These graphs are pretty straightforward and were made by graphing the catheter indication and sex/year data against the count of number of records. There were no rows that contained null values for these attributes.</p>

            <p> Some additional stuff about the trends:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There's a peak-dip-peak pattern between 2012-2015 for acute coronary syndrome</li>
                <li>You can see a dip in patient records in 2012 for stable angina</li>
                <li>Records for 'other' conditions dipped in 2013 and then rose until 2015</li>
                <li>There are very few records whether either the data entries were unknown or not recorded. 2012 has the highest count for unknown data. It also is shaped like a hump</li>
                <li>There's fluctuation noted between 2012-2015, the data generally plateaus by 2016 (except in 'Other' where it increases)</li>

            </ul>

            <p>The r-squared and p-values for the trendlines (trimmed to 4 decimal places, not rounded):</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Indication</th>
                    <th>R-squared</th>
                    <th>p-value</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Acute Coronary Syndrome</td>
                    <td>0.8146</td>
                    <td>0.0006</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Stable Angina</td>
                    <td>0.5789</td>
                    <td>0.0746</td>

                    <td>0.9287</td>
                    <td>0.0003</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Not Entered/Unknown</td>
                    <td>0.6475</td>

            <sub>Note:</sub><br>
            <sub>R-squared is a measure from 0 to 1 of how close the data is to the fitted trendline; higher is better.</sub><br>
            <sub>P-value is the probability that the equation for the trendline was a result of random chance; lower is better (&le; 0.05 is pretty good).</sub>

            <p>Linear trendlines represented most of the data pretty well. 'Stable Angina' wasn't great (R-squared = 0.3666, p-value = 0.0839), the dip in 2012 is probably contributing to that. The 'Unknown' category didn't do well with a linear trendline -- since it looks like a hump a linear trendline did an abysmal job representing it (R-squared = 0.0788, p-value = 0.4641).</p>
            <p>I switched to a polynomial representation of the trends and the trendline for the 'Unknown' category improved; the representation for the other categories also improved slightly. 'Stable Angina' <i>still</i> doesn't have as good scores as the others but it's better than it was with the linear trendline.</p>

            <p>I also went a little deeper and plotted the same line graph but partitioned the data by male and female, so you can see the trends in better detail.</p>

                   <p>Interestingly, the vertical positioning of the line charts mimics the height of the bar charts</p>

                   <p>Trends are still generally positive, the pattern for unknown data is pretty similar for both sexes</p>

            <p>If you have trouble seeing the trendlines, I've got them isolated here.</p>
