            Question 1
            <ul>
                <li>What is the distribution of catheter indication amongst males and females?</li>
                <li>Is there a specific year when each indication peaks or dips noticeably in the data? (changed from: Have any indications for catheters become prevalent in a specific year?)</li>
                <li>What are the trends of the recorded indications?</li>

            <p>
                I wanted to explore the data concerning their "indication for catheter", which refers to the result from the patients' cardiac catheterization -- which is a procedure used to diagnose and treat cardiovascular conditions. In the dataset there were four possible indications from the catheter file:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>acute coronary syndrome</b>: an umbrella term for situations where the blood supplied to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked <sup>[1]</sup></li>
                <li><b>stable angina</b>(also known as angina pectoris): chest pain or discomfort due to coronary heart disease<sup>[2]</sup>, which is a term for the buildup of plaque in the heart's arteries which can lead to heart attack<sup>[3]</sup></li>
                <li>other</li>
                <li>the indication is unknown/not entered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of the four, only two of them are actually a cardiovascular condition; <i>other</i> may indicate a condition that doesn't fall into the previous two categories but is still a known condition.</p>

            <p>To answer my question I looked at the record counts of these indications and viewed them by sex, year, and then both, and marked anything I thought was noteworthy as well as showed the trendlines for the record counts by year.</p>

            <p>First let's look at the gist of the data:</p>
            <div class="float-left" style="left:600px;bottom:100px;">
                <p>This bar graph shows the total count of files over all the years recorded in the dataset for each indication for a catheter.</p>
                <p>Acute coronary syndrome clearly has the highest count for both sexes.</p>
