            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The APPROACH dataset was provided by Danielle Southern, one of the clients for this course. APPROACH is an acronym for <b>A</b>lberta <b>P</b>rovincial <b>P</b>roject for <b>O</b>utcome <b>A</b>ssessment in <b>C</b>oronary <b>H</b>eart Disease. The individuals working on this project have a goal of making sure that patients are receiving the right treatments at the right times. They've been regularly collecting and processing information about patients (with their permission) to improve cardiac care.</p>

            <p><b>What kind of data are they collecting?</b></p>
            <p>APPROACH data has been collected at different stages of a patient's journey through the hospital, including information about their diagnostic procedures, and when they have treatments. Since this data involves personal information about patients it's been anonymized so it can be presented in public. I've also been given data from 2008 to 2016, so that's 8 years worth of data to analyze.</p>

            <p>The data has only been used to report the rates of procedures over the years, but the team wants to see if they can get more information out of their data.</p>

            <p><b>There's medical stuff related?</b></p>
            <p>This data deals with cardiovascular disease and references a lot of medical jargon that has to do with it. I'll be talking about stuff like coronary arteries, heart conditions, and procedures that are supposed to help relieve these conditions, and will explain any terms along the way of this story.</p>
            <p><b>The Data Story</b></p>
            <p>The following questions are actually only a few of my proposed questions, with some tweaks here and there. My original questions were mostly the same questions but each one had 2-4 miniature questions, so I wanted to break them up.</p>
            <p>All questions come with a visual, and there are observations for the visual that you can read if you hover your mouse over the image. An overall summary (and additional info) will be written below the image.</p>

            <h2>Question 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the distribution of catheterization indication amongst males and females?</li>
                <li>Is there a specific year when each category peaks or dips noticeably in the data? (changed from: Have any indications for catheters become prevalent in a specific year?)</li>
            </ul>
        </div> <!-- end title -->

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>
                I wanted to explore the data concerning their "indication for catheterization", which refers to the reason (what condition they have) for the patient's cardiac catheterization -- a procedure used to diagnose and treat cardiovascular conditions. In the dataset there were four possible indications for a patient's catheterization file:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>acute coronary syndrome</b>: an umbrella term for situations where the blood supplied to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked <sup>[1]</sup></li>
                <li><b>stable angina</b> (also known as angina pectoris): chest pain or discomfort due to coronary heart disease<sup>[2]</sup>, which is a term for the buildup of plaque in the heart's arteries which can lead to heart attack<sup>[3]</sup></li>
                <li>other</li>
                <li>the indication is unknown/not entered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of the four, only two of them are actually a cardiovascular condition; <i>other</i> may indicate a condition that doesn't fall into the previous two categories but is still a known condition.</p>

            <p>To answer my question I looked at the record counts of these conditions and viewed them by sex and year, separately.</p>

            <p>These graphs are pretty straightforward and were made by graphing the catheterization indication and sex/year data against the count of number of records. There were no rows that contained null values for these attributes.</p>

                <div class="info-box " style="left:-170px;bottom:100px;">
                    <p>This line graph shows the total (both sexes together) record count of the different conditions from 2008 to 2016. Noticeable peaks and dips are shown too.</p>

                <!-- info -->
                <div class="float-box " style="left:10px; bottom:470px;">
                    <p>Acute coronary syndrome clearly has the highest number of patients for both sexes</p>

                    <p>There are consistently less females with these conditions, roughly 1:2 female-to-male ratio in every category</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>In the line graph I've pointed out a few interesting peaks and dips in the record counts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The amount of patients with acute coronary heart syndrome rose in 2013, only to dip down again the next year, and then rise once more in 2015</li>
                <li>There's a noticeable dip in patients with stable angina in 2012, and then it rises by almost 500 patients in 2014</li>
                <li>In 2013, the number of patients with 'other' conditions dipped by about 100, only to rise over the next two years by almost 900 patients</li>
                <li>The highest count of unknown/not entered data for patients' conditions was in 2012</li>
            </ul>

            <sub>Note:</sub><br>
            <sub>R-squared is a measure from 0 to 1 of how close the data is to the fitted trendline; higher is better.</sub><br>
            <sub>P-value is the probability that the equation for the trendline was a result of random chance; lower is better (&le; 0.05 is pretty good).</sub>

            <p>I first tried linear trendlines and those represented most of the data pretty well. 'Stable Angina' wasn't great (R-squared = 0.3666, p-value = 0.0839), the dip in 2012 is probably contributing to that. The 'Unknown' category didn't do well with a linear trendline -- since it looks like a hump its linear trendline looked pretty flat, and so did an abysmal job representing the data (R-squared = 0.0788, p-value = 0.4641).</p>
            <p>In the end I switched to a polynomial representation of the trends and the trendline for the 'Unknown' category improved; the representation for the other categories also improved slightly. 'Stable Angina' <i>still</i> doesn't have as good scores as the others but it's better than it was with a linear trendline.</p>

            <p>I also went a little deeper and plotted the same line graph but partitioned the data by male and female, so you can see the trends in better detail.</p>

                   <p>The timelines for patient count now show only males or females. What you saw in the previous line graph was pretty much the sum of these line charts for each category.</p>
                   <p>These trendlines are also polynomial (degree 2).</p>
               </div>

               <div class="float-box" style="left:-20px;bottom:280px;">
                   <p>Interestingly, the proportional of the line charts is (mostly) similar to the height of the bar charts</p>
                   <p>Distance is not the same because the scales are different</p>
               </div>

               <div class="float-box" style="left:430px;bottom:250px;">
                   <p>Trends are still generally positive, the pattern for unknown data is pretty similar for both sexes</p>

            <p>The trendlines for unknown data [males] and 'Stable Angina' [males] aren't so good at representing their data (both have R-squared &lt; 0.55 -- it only represents about 55% of the data?!) and the line for stable angina [males] has a p-value of 0.2 (!!) so there's a 20% chance the line generated was random. This could be because the variation in data count is much bigger for males (more and steeper hills and valleys). I wanted to keep the calculation for these consistent with the previously calculated trendlines though.</p>
            <p>(The trendline for 'other' conditions [males] is <i>really</i> good!)</p>

            <h2>Question 3</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How many procedures in total are being done for each condition? (Not part of the original proposed questions, but this more specific than asking what the relationship is between number of procedures and the conditions?</li>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>I wanted to see if the condition the patient had affected how many procedures they went through, for example if patients with a condition classified 'Unknown' needed more PCIs because their condition was complicated (and therefore unidentifiable).</p>
            <p>We already know what a catheterization is, but what are the other procedures?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>percutaneous coronary intervention</b> (PCI): a non-surgical procedure used to treat narrowing of the coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary artery disease<sup>[4]</sup>
                    <ul>
                        <li>used in people with acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), unstable angina, and stable angina<sup>[4]</sup></li>
                        <li>is an alternative to CABG</li>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Since PCIs are often used in lieu of CABGs, we'd expect more patients to have more PCIs than CABGs in this dataset.</p>

            <p>This graph only looks at patients who had a catheterization file (some patients only appear to have a PCI or CABG file but no catheterization file, so I left them out for this analysis). To make it I counted the number of occurrences for each patient's file number in the PCI and CABG records and recorded them in a new column (one for each procedure).</p>

                    <p>Most PCIs recorded were for patients with acute coronary syndrome</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Considering acute coronary syndrome includes heart attacks and PCIs are for heart attacks, this data makes sense.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Question 4</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How many procedures have typically been recorded per patient? (A new question that wasn't originally in the proposed analysis questions, but I thought this would follow up well with Question 3) </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>These next graphs use the same data as the above graph, but now they're histograms showing the frequency of values for the number of procedures. They were created by binning the count of PCIs and CABGs (a range of integers starting at 0) in the dataset and then counting the occurrences of these bins. The counts are partitioned by condition.</p>

            <p>Here's the one for PCIs:</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="a99q4a.png">

                <div class="info-box" style="left:-170px;bottom:150px;">
                    <p>This histogram bins the possible values for number of <b>PCI</b> procedure records and counts the frequency of these values.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:100px;bottom:300px;">
                    <p>The highest count of procedures occurs in patients with acute coronary syndrome, but most patients with this condition don't even have a PCI record</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:490px;bottom:150px;">
                    <p>Though there's very low frequencies in these higher values, it's surprising that the patients had this many procedures done to them. We must also remember that this data is over the course of 8 years, so it's possible a patient could have a procedure done to them every year</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Here's the one for CABGs:</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="approach99-q4b.png">

                <div class="info-box" style="left:-170px;bottom:500px;">
                    <p>This one shows the possible values for number of <b>CABG</b> procedure records and their frequencies.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:300px;bottom:400px;">
                    <p>These frequencies are generally higher than the ones for PCIs, which means CABGs are less common amongst these patients</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>These numbers aren't too surprising since there are about 48,000 rows of PCI files and only about 12,000 rows of CABG files. Most patients with a catheterization file don't appear to have a CABG file.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Question 5:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Is there a relationship between the location (zone) of the patient and which facility they are having their procedure done? Does one facility seem to have more patients coming for a certain procedure than others?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>There are five zones in the dataset: Calgary, Central, Edmonton, North, and South. The hospitals shown as facilities in the dataset are: Foothills, University of Alberta, and Royal Alexandria. The latter two are located in Edmonton, Foothills is located in Calgary.</p>
        <p>Generally I would think that patients would have procedures done at the nearest hospital.</p>

        <p>The graphs below were made by graphing the facilities and zones in the data for each kind of procedure.</p>

        <div class="section-content">
            <div class="image">
                <p>Let's look at the distribution of patients with catheterization files.</p>
                <img src="a99q5a.png">

                <div class="float-box" style="left:480px;bottom:450px;">
                    <p>As expected, the majority of Calgary residents would go to Foothills since it's in their city</p>
                    <p>South residents would also be closer to Foothills than the other two</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:700px;bottom:100px;">
                    <p>Residents in Central, Edmonton and North would go to either of the Edmonton hospitals. The number of patients seems evenly split between U of A and Royal Alexandria</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Now for patients with PCI files.</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="a99q5b.png">
                <div class="float-box" style="left:50px;bottom:300px;">
                    <p>The distribution of PCI files is pretty similar to the catheterization files</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>And here we have patients with CABG files.</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="a99q5c.png">

                <div class="float-box" style="left:600px;bottom:400px;">
                    <p>Still the same, except no patients have had a CABG filed in Royal Alexandria, so any patients that did have one went to U of A Hospital</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Generally patients from the Calgary and South zone are going to Foothills Hospital for all procedures (catheterization, PCI, CABG) while patients from the Central, Edmonton and North zone are going either to University of Alberta or Royal Alexandria Hospital for procedures; except for CABGs, of which all patients in those areas went to University of Alberta Hospital for CABGs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Question 6:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Have Alberta health facilities been taking more and more non-Alberta patients or less?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>There are rows in the dataset for which no location is specified, which likely means that the patient is a non-Alberta resident. I wanted to see the rates for non-Alberta patients having procedures done at these hospitals.</p>

            <p>The line graph below was created by graphing the number of records for each procedure against year as well as facility.</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="approach99-q6.png">

                <div class="info-box" style="left:960px;bottom:200px;">
                    <p>These line graphs show the number of patient records for each year (2008-2016) and are each partitioned by facility.</p>
                    <p>Respectively, the first one shows patient records for catheterization files, then PCI files, then CABG files.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:300px;bottom:400px;">
                    <p>There was an influx of patients that had catheterizations done in Royal Alexandria Hospital in 2011</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:-10px;bottom:340px;">
                    <p>Foothills and U of A Hospital seem to have gained more patients for catheterizations over the years</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:490px;bottom:170px;">
                    <p>There was a spike in patients needing PCIs for Royal Alexandria, also in 2011</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box" style="left:660px;bottom:70px;">
                    <p>The amount of CABGs done hasn't changed much. Note how Royal Alexandria Hospital has no records at all</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The catheterization rates seem to have the highest difference between the minimum and maximum amount of procedures, and their rates are more erratic (more hills and valleys) than both PCI and CABG rates.</p>
            <p>I would conclude that Foothills and U of A Hospital have been taking more non-Alberta patients over the years for catheterizations and PCIs (but the trend aren't as prominent), but Royal Alexandria has been taking less.</p>
            <p>These graphs don't have trendlines because the R-squared and p-values for them were too low to justify keeping the lines. The rates change often enough that more than half the data isn't accurately represented by the trendline.</p>
