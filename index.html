        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The following questions are actually only a few of my proposed questions, with some tweaks here and there. My original questions were mostly the same questions but each one had 2-4 miniature questions, so I wanted to break them up.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Question 1:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the distribution of catheterization indication amongst males and females?</li>
                <li>Is there a specific year when each category peaks or dips noticeably in the data? (changed from: Have any indications for catheters become prevalent in a specific year?)</li>
            </ul>
        </div> <!-- end title -->

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>
                I wanted to explore the data concerning their "indication for catheterization", which refers to the reason (what condition they have) for the patient's cardiac catheterization -- a procedure used to diagnose and treat cardiovascular conditions. In the dataset there were four possible indications for a patient's catheterization file:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>acute coronary syndrome</b>: an umbrella term for situations where the blood supplied to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked <sup>[1]</sup></li>
                <li><b>stable angina</b> (also known as angina pectoris): chest pain or discomfort due to coronary heart disease<sup>[2]</sup>, which is a term for the buildup of plaque in the heart's arteries which can lead to heart attack<sup>[3]</sup></li>
                <li>other</li>
                <li>the indication is unknown/not entered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of the four, only two of them are actually a cardiovascular condition; <i>other</i> may indicate a condition that doesn't fall into the previous two categories but is still a known condition.</p>

            <p>To answer my question I looked at the record counts of these conditions and viewed them by sex and year, separately.</p>
            <p><b>(Hover over the charts for my observations!)</b></p>

                    <p>This bar graph shows the total count of files over all the years recorded in the dataset for condition.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box grey" style="left:760px;bottom:100px;">
                    <p>This line graph shows the total (both sexes together) record count of the different conditions from 2008 to 2016. Noticeable peaks and dips are shown too.</p>

                <!-- info -->
                <div class="float-box yellow" style="left:10px; bottom:470px;">
                    <p>Acute coronary syndrome clearly has the highest number of patients for both sexes</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box yellow" style="left:410px; bottom:470px;">
                    <p>There are consistently less females with these conditions, roughly 1:2 female-to-male ratio in every category</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float-box yellow" style="left:150px;bottom:20px;">
                    <p>In general there's a positive trend for number of patients over the years for each condition</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>These graphs are pretty straightforward and were made by graphing the catheterization indication and sex/year data against the count of number of records. There were no rows that contained null values for these attributes.</p>
            <p>In the line graph I've pointed out a few interesting peaks and dips in the record counts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The amount of patients with acute coronary heart syndrome rose in 2013, only to dip down again the next year, and then rise once more in 2015</li>
                <li>There's a noticeable dip in patients with stable angina in 2012, and then it rises by almost 500 patients in 2014</li>
                <li>In 2013, the number of patients with 'other' conditions dipped by about 100, only to rise over the next two years by almost 900 patients</li>
                <li>The highest count of unknown/not entered data for patients' conditions was in 2012</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Question 2:</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>In general there's fluctuation in number of patients noted between 2012-2015 for all categories, and the data generally plateaus (almost flat incline or decline) by 2016</li>

            <sub>Note:</sub><br>
            <sub>R-squared is a measure from 0 to 1 of how close the data is to the fitted trendline; higher is better.</sub><br>
            <sub>P-value is the probability that the equation for the trendline was a result of random chance; lower is better (&le; 0.05 is pretty good).</sub>

            <p>Linear trendlines represented most of the data pretty well. 'Stable Angina' wasn't great (R-squared = 0.3666, p-value = 0.0839), the dip in 2012 is probably contributing to that. The 'Unknown' category didn't do well with a linear trendline -- since it looks like a hump a linear trendline did an abysmal job representing it (R-squared = 0.0788, p-value = 0.4641).</p>
            <p>In the end I switched to a polynomial representation of the trends and the trendline for the 'Unknown' category improved; the representation for the other categories also improved slightly. 'Stable Angina' <i>still</i> doesn't have as good scores as the others but it's better than it was with a linear trendline.</p>

            <p>I also went a little deeper and plotted the same line graph but partitioned the data by male and female, so you can see the trends in better detail.</p>

            <p>You can see that the trendlines aren't as good (the ones for unknown data [males] and stable angina [males] is pretty bad, R-squared &lt; .55, and the line for stable angina [males] has a p-value of .2 so there's a 20% chance the line generated was random). I wanted to keep the calculation for these consistent with the previously calculated trendlines though.</p>
